        "## Background

This example is designed to simulate a field experiment for wheat strip rust with in 5 * 28
plots with 1.524 m x 1.524 m (5 ft by 5 ft) grid cells. The experiment was planted
with a non-resistant variety of wheat and multiple treatments were performed. 
This example will demonstrate setting up the data for the model and the treatments, 
running calibration and validation, and comparing simulation results to observed 
data. We are ignoring the effect of weather on disease spread for this example.

## Data setup
# Initial conditions

For the field experiment, the starting conditions of each field were identical. 
Each field was inoculated so that 1.1% of the total population of wheat was inoculated with WSR on 5/14/2014."
